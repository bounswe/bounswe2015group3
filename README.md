#Cmpe Social Life

CMPE @ BOUN is a very busy department. It has faculty members, undergraduates, graduates, support staff, and alumni.

There are official and unofficial issues that are maintained on a daily basis. With the load and variety of work this can be difficult to manage. Furthermore, with all the activity going on it is difficult to create and maintain meaningful connection with other people and information.

This project is developed by the people going with the name "bounswe2015group3".

The current version of our platform can be seen at:

The apk for our android application is stored as app-debug.apk. As the name suggests, it is still under development.
